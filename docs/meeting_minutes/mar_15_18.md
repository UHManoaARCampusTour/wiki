# Meeting Minutes for March 15th, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Created 3 seperate windmills varying in blade size
- Windmill blades will continually spin
- Windmills are configured such that they interact with the online server so a user can change the windmill through a mobile device

## Problems
- The application will only work in Unity and not if the app is deployed.
- May need to take a different approach in terms of how the users are going to interact with the environment.

## Reminders
- Turn in Mid report by March 31, 2018 at 11:59 pm.

## Goals
- Reconsider the user interacting with a mobile device to interact with the holograms and find a potential alternative method

## Notes
- We want to focus on either localization and our position or use spacial recognition to determine where we are
- Explore the use of eye beacons (ask Jessie!)
- Unity GPS integration
- Get in contact with admissions
