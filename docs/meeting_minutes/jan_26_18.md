# Meeting Minutes for January 26th, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Followed [Microsoft tutorials](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/academy) to generate our first "Hello World" program
  - This involved setting up Unity to produce a Hololens project
  - Created a single cube, 2 meters in front of the user
  - Created a cursor that follows the user's gaze in sample "Origami" project
- Experiment with gravity and adjusting the floor (we made the discovery, that a transparent (black) floor is ideal)

## Problems
- Playing with the floor to make it look realistic was a little finicky
- Saw that seeing our hand through the Hololens was difficult, look to change opacity
- Possible issue with testing this outside, need of network, executable, etc.

## Reminders
- N/A

## Goals
- Continue with tutorials
- Get Keane's new computer started with the Hololens and Unity
