# Meeting Minutes for February 22nd, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Created a cilent server model to interface with Unity
- Proof of concept was confirmed as we could remove a sprite on command through a mobile device


## Problems
- The application will only work in Unity and not if the app is deployed.
- May be different for prefabs and other objects in Unity.

## Reminders
- Turn in Mid report by March 31, 2018 at 11:59 pm.

## Goals
- Reconfigure the code so that we can add or remove objects rather than sprites.
- Make windmill objects and replace the sprites with the windmill objects

## Notes
- We want to focus on either localization and our position or use spacial recognition to determine where we are
- Explore the use of eye beacons (ask Jessie!)
- Unity GPS integration
- Get in contact with admissions
