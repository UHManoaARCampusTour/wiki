# Meeting Minutes for February 6th, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Decided to take a different route in the project and work with a top-bottom approach rather than a bottom-up
- Instead of doing Unity tutorials and trying to get to our end goal, we decided to figure out what we needed for the project
- Began looking into Vuforia and was able to get 2D pictures and project a 3D image or prefab over the 2D picture

## Problems
- The dectection of the 2D picutres is not too well and the image needs to be looked at in decent lighting and a good angle

## Reminders
- Meeting with Dr. Carlson on Friday at 2/16/18 at 2:30 pm

## Goals
- Clarify initial use case
- Determine what our experince would look like
- Determine what 3D assets we would want to use

- Do survey/research on past project on their implentations of localization or geometric recognization
- We can build on this idea and improve upon the structure
- Build upon and reimplement portions of other projects

## Notes
- We want to focus on either localization and our position or use spacial recognition to determine where we are
- Explore the use of eye beacons (ask Jessie!)
- Unity GPS integration
- Get in contact with admissions
