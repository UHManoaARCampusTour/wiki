# Meeting Minutes for March 28th, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Worked with windmill simulation and enabled voice command and cursor gaze ability to select
- Windmill will spin and stop on select gaze command as well as voice commmand

## Problems
- The windmill will only go if the gaze is selected by the propeller rather than the entire windmill itself (base included)

## Reminders
- Turn in Mid report by March 31, 2018 at 11:59 pm.

## Goals
- Use Vuforia to make a panel
- Fix windmill bug
- Create a world environment for the windmill

## Notes
- We want to focus on either localization and our position or use spacial recognition to determine where we are
- Explore the use of eye beacons (ask Jessie!)
- Unity GPS integration
- Get in contact with admissions
