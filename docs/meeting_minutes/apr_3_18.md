# Meeting Minutes for April 3rd, 2018

Attending: Keane Hamamura and Dylan Tokita

## Updates
- Turned off the drawing mesh in the spatial mapping object so the users won't be distracted by the mesh
- Created virtual environment to support the windmill and enhance the experience for the user
- Moved the windmill closer to the person 

## Problems
- The windmill will only go if the gaze is selected by the propeller rather than the entire windmill itself (base included)
- The speech function isn't as responsive as before.

## Reminders
- Turn in abstract through google form by Monday April 9, 2018
- Be ready for the poster presentation on April 26, 2018 from 11:15 am to 1:15 pm
- Work on the poster itself and collect images from the project


## Goals
- Use Vuforia to make a panel
- Fix windmill bug


## Notes
- Ask Jessie for potential help in Vuforia
- Go through the tutorials to understand the concepts better
