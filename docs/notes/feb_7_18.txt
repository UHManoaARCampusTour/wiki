We can use Vuforia's SDK in order to have the hololens view real life objects. This may allow us to recognize the Gate of Hope and other structures. 

According to brief research, it shows that Vuforia's SDK may allow us to simply overlay our UI over whatever object we want.

Concerns:

1. Explore how viewing angle affects Vuforia, if viewing angle needs to be specific, then we will need to figure out a workflow in which this occurs.
